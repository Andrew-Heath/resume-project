		I am 24 years old and have lived in Yorba Linda for most of my life.  Since a young age I have 
		been around computers and electronics and have been fascinated by them for well over half of my 
		life.  While learning about stuff from my father I was put into a variety of summer camps focused 
		on electronics and technology.  These included a beginner's course on robots, web page design, 
		game design, and video editing.

		I attended El Dorado High School in Placentia, CA and graduated in 2008.  I excelled in the areas 
		of mathematics, physical sciences, and computer science, and I still have a great interest in 
		these subjects.  During my Junior year I was able to take a course on Visual Basic, which was 
		used as an introductory course for the AP Java course I took the following year.  The AP Java 
		course was truly the course to decide in my want to become a computer programmer, showing me a 
		glimpse of what kinds of programs could be written, including programming robots made from LEGO 
		Mindstorms.

		After high school I attended Fullerton Community College for four years.  Aside from general 
		education courses, I took courses on C and C++, continuing to grow my interest in the field.  I 
		also took a basic course on computer and network security, expanding my views past just 
		programming and to keep myself aware of other issues in the field of computer information 
		services.  On my own, I have used resources like Code School to learn more about HTML, CSS, 
		and JavaScript.
	</p>
	<p class="text-body">
		I also have many other interests besides computers.  Video games have always been an interest of 
		mine, and I enjoy playing a wide variety of them.  I also enjoy various board games and pen and 
		paper games.  Music plays a large part in my life and the range of styles I like is vast.  I have 
		picked up the guitar, taking some private lessons but mostly self taught from looking up tablature 
		online.  Another hobby I partake in is table-top miniatures games, in which you assemble and paint 
		miniatures of various sizes to play a game with.

		Personal Skills
	</h2>
	<p class="text-body">
		When it comes to things involving computers, I absorb new information very quickly.  Whether it's related 
		to programming or not, I can understand and utilize what I learn after only just a bit of practice.  This 
		also extends to the fields of mathematics and systems, mechanical or informational.  I work very well in 
		a group, willing to split a workload as best fits the group's strengths and give and take help as 
		required.  I can also work well on my own, especially on things that will require a degree of detail.  I 
		am good at solving numerical and logical problems, and often find joy in successfully solving these 
		issues.  If I don't understand something, I will research it on my own if I have no one in my immediate 
		vicinity I can ask for clarification.  I can type decently fast and keep my handwriting as legible as 
		possible.
